# PerceptionProject
The context of this project is a quality control scenario under an Industry 4.0 perspective. Quality control is performed with a stereo camera fixed in the environment overlooking at a conveyor. The objects on the conveyor need to be tracked in 3D, even if occlusion happen and need to be classified in their object class. 

The aim of this report is to explain how we first calibrate and rectify the stereo input, then how we detect the object and finally how we classify the objects that are detected.
